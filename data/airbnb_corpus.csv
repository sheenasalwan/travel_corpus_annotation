If the White Temple was meant to be a stairway to heaven, the Black House has been called a “dark, mysterious, and almost sadistic” representation of hell, complete with preserved animals and a collection of bones. 

Built by Thailand national artist Thawan Duchanee (who incidentally was the mentor of Chaloemchai, the White Temple guy), the Baan dam Museum (Black House) is a cluster of nearly 40 small shadowy structures exhibiting art dating back to the Ayutthaya period.

For that reason, I made an itinerary adapted to the cold season : less windy spots, some warm breaks inside buildings (if open) and some secrets to keep you warm.

My Winter Walking Tour of Old Quebec is an introduction to local history and architecture, but it's Winter and therefore I'll focus a little bit on this season. Its impact on architecture, history and culture. You'll learn about New France, the Conquest, the American revolution, the evolution of the city, the French-Canadians & Anglo-Canadians, but also about the ice bridge and the Winter Carnaval for example.

Finally, you'll discover a quaint city where every street corner is a postcard.

Yes, you can enjoy a 2h walking tour in Old Quebec, from November to March, without losing a frozen toe, without frost bite.

NB : if you would like a tour in French, please contact me (Tours Accolade Quebec), I could add a tour in French. For Spanish, a colleague can provide a private tour.

Typically featuring a design with the fearless faces of ogres and gargoyles, these carved tiles found at the ends of the main roof ridge have been protecting the roofs of Japanese buildings from evil, and rainwater, since ancient times.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/634994,"e-Noble - UP, UP and AWAY! Here's your chance to experience the fun of flying PRIVATELY. 
Yes, that’s right. No delays, no shuffling from queue to queue, or huge airports. 
This is the real deal - flying in a small aircraft with a local pilot, who just wants to share the magic of flight.

Your pilot is key to this adventure. They are sharing the flights' direct cost, not making a profit. They just love to fly and want you to understand their passion for aviation.  
So be sure to meet your pilot directly at the airfield provided, as there's no airport inside of Paris but there are several private airfields around, normally reachable by public transportation in 30-90 min.

++Confirm weather conditions with your pilot before++ --> Access a local and non-commercial airfield --> Discuss the flight route together with your pilot --> Pre-flight check --> Up you go, in the air! 
Enjoy the view from a whole new perspective! 

NOTICE: 
-The flight can depart anytime between 9-17h, depending on the availability of the pilot and the aircraft. You can book time frame on Airbnb and let us know your flexible hours/days after the reservation
-No flights are allowed to fly over Paris, so you will fly over the surrounding area with a far but clear view of the city

You will learn how to create your own Nihonga painting, a Japanese pigment painting that is completely different from ""sumi-e"" ink painting or other medium. 

First, you’ll work on a rough sketch that will eventually become a painting. (Hint: travel is a great source of inspiration!)
Next, choose your canvas: either thick Japanese paper or a paper fan. Then, trace your sketch using sumi (black ink). It can be tricky for you, but it’s also super fun!  
After outlining your sketch with sumi-ink, you’ll color your work with all-natural mineral pigments , adding a subtle vibrancy to your painting. 　※Mineral pigments mixing FISH glue with your finger.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1235993,"Dev Diwali translates to 'the Diwali of the Gods' or 'festival of lights of the Gods' and is celebrated to commemorate the day that Shiva killed the demon Tripur. The Gods celebrated Shiva's victory by lighting lamps and that is the reason, this occasion is also called Dev Diwali. Celebrated on Kartik Poornima (the full moon in the month of November). It is one of the most important festivals of Varanasi.

 It is a beautiful sight when the steps of all the ghats on the riverfront of the Ganges River, from Assi Ghat at the southern end to Rajghat at north, are lit with more than a million earthen lamps (diyas) in honour of the river. The gods are believed to descend to Earth to bathe in the Ganges on this day. There will be different types of performances happening on various ghats.

We take a shared boat ride (There will be a separate Boatman who will row the boat. The guide and the guest will simply sit and enjoy the experience) and watch the beautifully lit ghats in front of us along with a full moon on the day of Dev Diwali.

At dusk, we take a local boat on what is referred to as the `River of Heaven’ immersing in  daily ritual, rich with the chanting of priests, sound of temple bells and  fragrance of flowers and incense. We see brahmins along the banks invoking Lord Shiva, most powerful in the Hindu trinity, with a ceremonial ritual known as Aarti.  
Aarti is a Sanskrit word for homage or devotion. The aarti or offering of lamps is observed at prescribed hours of the day and night to invoke the gods.  It is believed that the gods physically present themselves before devotees at this ceremony. Lamps are revolved before the idol in a clockwise manner along with the chanting of hymns. This recitation is accompanied by drums, blowing of the conch-shell and the tolling of temple bells. At the end of the `aarti’, the priest takes a handful of water which he revolves around the god's idol. This is to pacify `agni’ (the fire god), who is pressed into service in the form of a wick lamp. The lamps themselves are charged with this ""presence"" and thus after the ceremony devotees collect the fumes and smear their faces with its aroma.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/760776,"在大约3.5小时的游览中（一般为日落前3.5小时开始，日落时分结束），大家将跟随我与Matteo一起走进这个浓缩了2800年罗马史的平民区，除了历史轶事之外，我也会详细讲述罗马各种令人匪夷所思的传说和意大利传统艺术形式（湿壁画、马赛克等）的制作方法，而Matteo会向大家介绍他在这个街区成长的趣事与罗马的民俗文化。旅程中主要途径的景点如下：

1 圣玛利亚大教堂与同名广场 （Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere）
穿过曲折狭窄的巷子，眼前忽然开阔。相传，这座圣殿是罗马第一个举行弥撒仪式的地点，也是第一座献给圣母玛利亚的教堂。它的历史可以追溯到基督教还没有普及的公元3世纪，如今我们所看到的是12世纪重建后的面貌。同样古老的还有广场上的喷泉，古罗马时代它就已是一个取水口，布拉曼特与贝尔尼尼两位大师给予了它今日的外观。

2 西斯托古桥与台伯河沿岸 （Ponte Sisto）
台伯河，代表了罗马的灵魂，但同时也带给这座它孕育的城市无数的灾难，西斯托古桥就是最好的历史证明。在2000多年的历史中，因为洪水的缘故，它不断地经历坍塌、修复和重建。在还没有筑起河提的年代，人们通过观察桥身上那个被称为 “罗马之眼”的圆环来判断水灾的来临。

3 伦加拉街（Via della Lungara） 
一条古老的街道，古罗马时期它是帝王花园与法外之地的交集，中世纪时期它是通往圣彼得大教堂的朝圣之路，文艺复兴时期它是达官贵族们修筑别院的钟情之处。塞维鲁城门、猞猁之眼国家科学院、法尔内西纳别墅、天皇后监狱，它们代表了一个又一个重要的历史片段。

3 拉斐尔情人的故居 （Casa della Fornarina）
也许你没有听过她的名字，但你却很可能在拉斐尔的诸多作品中见过她的脸庞。他年纪轻轻就已是那个时代最受追捧的艺术家，而她，玛格丽特，只是平民区中一个面包师的女儿。如今，她曾经住过的房子依然竖立在那个巷口，遥望着他在一街之隔的宫殿里所留下的绝美画作。

4 布拉曼特礼拜堂（Tempietto del Bramante）
艺术史的必修课，教科书中的经典，文艺复兴理念的完美展现。整个建筑的中心直指圣彼得殉难十字架的所在之处。布拉曼特，这位曾参与设计圣彼得大教堂的建筑大师一生作品无数，然而这座小小的八角形礼拜堂才是其最有影响力的代表作。

5 宝拉喷泉（ Fontana dell’Acqua Paola）
曾经看过穷游锦囊的一个提问“你有被一张图片种草而前往一个旅行目的地的经历吗？”，某位驴友的回答就是这座出现在《绝美之城》第一幕中的喷泉。尽管比起著名的许愿池而言，它是朴素的，但是它依然足够令你难忘，因为它竖立在山巅之上，面对的是整座永恒之城。

6 贾尼科洛山丘观景台（Terrazza del Gianicolo）
每到夕阳西下之时，总会有一些当地的爱侣来到这里，他们挽着手漫步在山顶的林荫大道，安静地欣赏着落日的余晖洒在鳞次栉比的屋顶上。而对于游客来说，在270°的观景台上面对壮观的罗马全景，细数白天走过的路、参观过的景点不失为一种有趣的体验。

You (and your companion) ride comfortably and safely in the front of this custom-built rickshaw imported from Indonesia. This  rickshaw, known in Indonesia as a becak, enhances the sightseeing experience by having the driver behind you, out of your line of vision.

The idea is not to talk about a huge amount of historical facts, nor to treat you as just another tourist. The purpose is to experience and feel the city as a REAL LOCAL, a real ""malagueño"".
The duration of this activity is 2,5 h. approximately which starts with a nice coffee or tea at one of the most iconic squares of the city: Plaza de la Merced.
Then, the walk will get started around the historical area in order to discover the most well-known places (as well as surprising, unknown ones) of the centre, while talking about history, curiosities, traditions... and some stories as well :) Where do locals go, what are our customs, where do we go and what do we eat?

My aim is to delve into the architectural essence of the Master and dig deep into his visual power, which is what made him an inspiration for the Surrealists and has earned him the honor of being the Best-Known Spanish Architect.

Our discussion will focus on a set of turning points that include a project in early 20th-century Manhattan, the last commission from his patron, Eusebi Güell, and his first architectural steps with the Sagrada Família.

I will explain you about eclecticism and the end of modernism, the Crypt of Colony Güell and the Sagrada Família, utopian socialism, positivist materialism, the intellectual bourgeoisie, the Spanish Civil War, anarchism, beatification and deliquescent surfaces.

You will be welcomed to your retreat with Herbal teas and shown to your sanctuary healing room where a two hour sound healing journey awaits.
The singing bowls and tuning forks form the basis of my private sessions. The hand crafted bowls are made with crystal-infused metal, which creates a perfect resonance of harmonic overtones when played on and over the body. The resonating sounds transfer energy in the form of sound waves through your body. These sound vibrations lower blood pressure, reduce heart breathing rates and calm brain activity helping to restore the natural healing frequency of the body.  Played over energy centres sound is absorbed at a cellular level. The steady movement of the bowls over the body and the vibrations that they emanate help to balance energy centres and harmonise the body mind.  After the session I offer you local knowledge of our beautiful surrounding area where there are great walking trails and an abundance of wildlife.

You make the most of the day by visiting three local breweries and a distillery. The tour includes transportation so you can drink safely and comfortably without worrying about how you will get home. All tastings at each brewery and distillery are included so you won’t get thirsty ;p.  You will also get lunch at one of the breweries and a sweet tour of the coast and some of the luscious hinterland that surrounds Byron.

This little slice of paradise is the perfect place for beer culture to thrive. Not only does it attract hundreds of thousands of travellers, many of whom are international, but the land itself provides the perfect backdrop to enjoy a crisp beer, whether it’s at the beach or exploring the hinterland.

Note: If you aren’t a beer drinker there are plenty of other options at the breweries. If you’d prefer cider, spirits etc we can accomodate. Although I do guarantee I’ll find you a beer you’ll like!

I am so grateful to be the FIRST and ONLY person permitted by Queensland Park and Wildlife Services (QPWS) to take guests into Tewantin National Parks single-track mountain bike trails on eBikes.  

Starting after lunch, we'll take the eBikes into the park so you can discover the hidden tracks and trails and experience the amazing new sport of eMtn Biking.

I've got 7 top of the range, state of the art, dual suspension electric mountain bikes from Giant (world leading manufacturer).  These bikes are incredibly comfortable and easy to ride off road with large wide tyres for extra grip and soft suspension for extra comfort.  Normally this would make riding hard work, but the small, silent motor assists as you pedal.  It rides, handles and feels like any bike but suddenly you can climb hills whilst having a conversation and without sweating.  No one gets left behind.

We'll take these bikes through the manicured bike trails, stopping along the way to witness how the flora changes in such a small area. Glide up to the top of the trails and then flow back down.  You'll find your inner child returns with smiles from ear to ear.

You will need a car as it's a 10 min drive to the penguin colony, then a short walk on a boardwalk onto a beach area. Here, you will be waiting  in a seated area with the waves crashing nearby for the penguins to arrive. They will start to appear in little groups at dusk and will wander up their special paths on the beach. Simultaneously, you will start to hear the calls of the little penguins to their mates, guiding them to their nests. I will have special lights to allow you to see the penguins, without causing any disruption or distress to the penguins as they go about their penguin business. Most penguins will be ashore within 30 minutes of dusk, where they will head towards their nests. Once home, we will do a walk along the beach where we can get very close to the penguins outside their nests and you'll be amazed at how happy they are with us there.

We will start at the iconic Santa Monica pier, with a  photography session. My idea is to give you something to cherish from this tour!!
Within a few yards is our first spot, a Santa Monica favorite sports beer bar. Best part, it’s really good for its price.
 A few blocks away, we head to a Mexican inspired, known for its live music and real good cocktails spot. 

Next along our route is the Brit pub. Good beer, great fish and chips along with a cozy British shoppe to take a minute and stroll around. 
Exactly a block away, this American restaurant which is know for its food is now gaining popularity for its signature cocktails too. The ambience gives you the feels of an upscale speakeasy experience.
I will now bring my camera out again and as we walk towards our last spot, we will cross the 3rd street promenade. A pedestrian mall which is always lit up and always has street artists performing and making it lively.
This last one is the crowd favorite. Surfing themed, retro feel with multiple bars and patios. Onlooking the ocean this will be our last stop.

The Lucia Light creates a profound inner journeying experience, a mystical state of consciousness – the kind that monks experience after years of meditation practice.

With closed eyes, this 20-minute experience lets you see the movie of your mind - beautiful colours and patterns and shapes, all a creation of your own being. The light gently entrains brainwaves into a deep meditative state as lush landscapes of colour float by. Immersed in this kaleidoscopic world, you’re presented with the profound beauty of your very own quantum consciousness. 

The Lucia Light was developed by Austrian neurologist Dr Dirk Proeckl and clinical psychologist Dr Engelbert Winkler. Its reported benefits include:

· Reduced anxiety, stress, fear and depression
· Increased creativity
· More restful sleep
· Sense of oneness
· Access astral travel and inner journeys
· Increased sense of peace
· Increased intuition
· Improved physical healing
· Release of beneficial hormones

- We will treat you like a person, not a number: We keep smaller classes (7 people or less unless specially requested otherwise) for a more individualized experience. We also won't 'stack' our classes back to back and leave time between classes.

- We take care of our equipment, no tattered wetsuits, no faded/falling apart boards.

Then, you can meet the bar master and other guests there and feel the warm and open environment here. Unlike bars in other countries, Japanese LGBT bars are small, intimate spaces where we can communicate and get to know each other easily.

Next, I'll show you around the town so you can get a sense of where the locals go, and understand Nichome as your own. For the next two bars, we can decide on which spots to visit based on what you all want to do that night. There are so many choices here, but that means there is something for everyone here, and I will only take you to bars that I enjoy and usually visit when I come to Nichome, so no matter where we go, just know that you can feel the real LGBT heart in Tokyo there.

You will enter the exclusive main hall of the temple, which locals are rarely given a chance to visit. The Buddhist practice of Shakyo is a means of spreading the Buddhist Way. But today, aside from these religious purposes, Shakyo is performed in order to reflect on ourselves, or to attain mental wellbeing by mindfully tracing the sacred scriptures. It does not matter if one has faith in Buddhism or not, or if one’s writing is good or not. First of all, I will dress you in a kimono, and then we will start Shakyo by copying from the sutras. Shakyo is normally done while in the seiza (sitting straight) position. There is a small chair to help with that, but if it's too tiring or difficult, there is a table we can use instead. After Shakyo, we will have Japanese teatime and photography. For locals, it is a rare chance to talk to the chief priest and take photos together. You will experience different aspects of the temple in Asakusa. And it's a good way to purify and train oneself.

After the great views we will head into Halls Gap for a delicious lunch at the Harvest Cafe before the drive up to Mackenzie Falls. This small walk is a steep 2km trail but you will be rewarded with one of Victoria's largest and most beautiful waterfalls. Feel free to dip your toes in the icy mountain water to refresh your feet.

Our next stop is the picturesque Boroka Lookout where you will be able to experience stunning views of Halls Gap, Lake Bellfield and Mt William mountain ranges.

Before heading back to Melbourne we’ll say goodbyes to our wild local friends: kangaroos & emus at their very favourite hangout spot.

See what it’s like to connect with them, by being among them and observing them up close, undisturbed? This is a therapeutic and relaxing experience, one that allows you to turn off and forget the outside World while you’re interacting with the animals. 
Research indicates that interaction with therapy animals can temporarily affect the release of various neurotransmitters in the brain. Oxytocin levels (linked with bonding) and dopamine levels (involved in the reward-motivation system) are increased, while cortisol levels (an immunosuppressant associated with stress) are decreased. 
(https://goatyoga.net/goat-therapy-animal-assisted-therapy/)
Our goats are calm and tend to have a calming and soothing effect. They are very mild tempered and perfectly safe to be around, even for small children. You will be able to feed them treats, brush and groom them, we can also teach you how to milk them if you’d like (seasonally) and you will have the opportunity to try their milk.
We can stay with you to answer your questions and tell you about our animals, or we can leave you with them for a private and intimate experience. Depending on the time of the year, there may be baby goats to watch, hold and play with!

Surrounded by iconic landmarks, it’s just you, your closest friends and a local guide who knows exactly where to find the coolest spots on Sydney’s downtown shores. 

Aye, captain - this is the ultimate tour for you if you really want to see Sydney like a local. In fact, I’m the only one in Sydney offering guided self-drive boat tours of the harbour.

Don’t worry if you have no experience or boating licence. Most of my guests have never driven a boat before - but after 5-10 minutes they are completely comfortable and able to navigate the harbour confidently. 

If you really want to discover all the fascinating stories Sydney Harbour has to offer, this trip provides you with the best value.

During this walking tour you will learn how to “read” Rome, an ancient city, reborn in the fifteenth century and reshaped substantially in the following three centuries. You will discover how Renaissance and Baroque Rome’s urban form, art, and architecture projected the city’s image of itself to its citizens (URBI) and the world (ORBI). Popes, architects, scholars and sculptors invested in Rome a variety of narratives that strove to explain the city’s history, convince its citizens and visitors of its harmony, and exhort society at large to share in and shape its destiny. The city that resulted became a destination for pilgrims and Grand Tourists, and still is today.

Japanese people have traditionally lived together with nature.

The local people are still living in the traditional way.
So there you can see typical traditional life, rice fields, farmlands, forests, shrines, temples and old Japanese style houses as in the movie. 
We will also visit a tea farmer's house where they provide you a real Japanese green tea since this area is one of the top tea producing areas in Japan. 
There is no such a nice and enjoyable area to taste the Japanese countryside near Tokyo.

This full day photography tour will let you see the raw Delhi, experience its culture and feast on amazing local food while I will endlessly hunt for that perfect light and angle for your portraits.


I will also tell you some interesting tidbits which are rooted in the past and are folklore. I will capture your best moments against the city's vivid backdrop whether it is in the narrow lanes of old Chandni Chowk or  bustling art scene in New Delhi. Yes, the city never ceases to surprise!

Hey guys!

In this experience, we will be conducting night & day photoshoots in charming and scenic locations where famous films were shot. 

This is a cinema-themed experience so we'll not conduct a photoshoot in the traditional sense.

Instead of fashion-style portraits, what you will get here is mostly ""candid"" photos in the urban environment, the real Parisian life, the small streets, the cafés, the unseen corners that inspire filmmakers and artists... Behind each photo there is a film, a story, a legend! 

We'll not be recreating the movie scenes for the most part, but instead we'll create our own ""movie"". We'll play with the city lights, the sun and the shadows, the contrast, in order to create the most cinematic/atmospheric/moody portraits and scenes possible. 

No problem if you don't know how to pose, you don't have to. Just be yourself. Ideal for couples! 

This photoshoot will also allow you to discover movie locations, listen to stories and historical facts on the movies/locations and walk through some cool hidden spots you would probably not find on your own. 
The goal of this experience however is to capture the best photos possible!

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/25286,"We'll meet in our own home garden situated in the bushland suburb of Bilgola Plateau on Sydney's beautiful Northern Beaches.  We'll dive right into the Garden Design process, looking at examples and discussing the following:

*Understanding your garden style [or helping you find what you might like!] 
*Understanding your site: existing vegetation, ecosystems, soil, micro-climate influences, services, orientation, access, functional needs.
* Design principles:
Form, line, proportion, scale, colour, texture, rhythm, harmony, contrast, axis, focal points, framing.
Neuroscience of design: prospect, refuge, mystery, risk [the best bit in my humble opinion!]
*Bringing it together: 
Plant & materials selection, construction considerations, maintenance.

Yes, it sounds like a lot, but we'll focus on the bits that most interest you and that will give you the confidence to design your own patch. We'll be as hands-on as possible and I always try to fit in a fun potting activity which demonstrates the intriguing way our brains react so beneficially to engaging with nature.

We'll have morning tea and spend time wandering through our own rather wild garden where I have been practicing  many of the topics we've discussed. This is what makes this garden design experience unique: sharing our failures & successes and learning about the simple design tactics that make all the difference.","Sydney, Australia",Art and culture

You will start by picking out your wood blanks from an assortment of hardwoods, both natural and dyed that will be assembled during our workshop, cut, carved, engraved if you like, polished and finished into something you can really be proud of. At the end of the workshop feel free to bring your own tobacco or otherwise seeing as how this is Colorado.... and give your new pipe a try on the patio!

Feel free to bring a friend to observe for FREE! However seating is limited and prioritized for paying participants

work order will go:
-Pick your wood
-Design your shapes
-Assemble the blanks with glue and clamps
-Write down what you would like to have laser engraved into the pipe while we take a quick beer/wine break
-Sanding and finishing and engraving
-Enjoy your new creation!

The whole process will last roughly an hour and a half to two hours, we will be in my shop (Garage) the entirety of the work time and mainly you will be using a rotary tool with an extension attachment (makes it like using a pen to carve/sand rather than holding the entire tool). I will have music playing and examples for ideas, like I mentioned feel free to bring things to try with your new pipe after we are done or BYOB  while we work as well. Just use common sense, we will be working with power tools that have sharp bits.

Then we’ll walk along the waterfront trail back to my apartment, where we’ll enjoy some refreshments.  Here we will look at and digitally label our photos to make a picture dictionary of our adventure.  (This activity is sometimes referred to as “Picture Word Induction Model”, or PWIM for short!)

Next, we’ll write our sentences (don’t worry, I can help you!), and play a fun and interactive sorting game with the words.  You will get really good at writing your sentence and reading it out loud, and then you can share it with everyone else in the group (if you feel comfortable).

Finally, we will celebrate our learning with a group photo before we end this experience and say good bye to our new friends.

The temples are devoid of mass tourism. The area had a bad reputation for bandits but they are long gone leaving behind some incredible Indian history and architecture. 
Our first stop will be the Bateshwar Temple ruins followed by Garhi Padhavali and finally Mitawali temple.

Bringing kids out for their first hike? I highly recommend my Pacific Crest Trail hike. This is an easy hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, and I often see wild burros here in the winter months.
My winter hikes are to areas such as: 
Pacific Crest Trail above Baldwin Lake, Hiking ability easy
Snow Forest (An old abandoned ski resort with epic views of the lake) Hiking ability moderate to advanced, lots of altitude gain.
Holcomb Valley, an old mining area, hiking ability easy to moderate
Sugarloaf Mountain, hiking ability advanced, lots of altitude gain.
This listing is for my two-hour hike but if you wish to do a longer half-day hike to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain, or Butler's Peak or partway up snowy San Gorgonio Trails I host those too. You can message me for pricing.
I start hosting this hike around Thanksgiving, when we may not have any snow on the ground but I will share with my guests a secret local place they can play in the snow after a mile hike uphill with great views.

Being able to observe these animals in their natural habitat will be an experience you won't forget.  FYI, with over 100 ravens here, please be advised that they are very smart, very social, and love to talk!  They may even bring you a special present that they have picked up from the desert floor!  You can also sit right next to a tortoise and watch the bunnies & squirrels run & play.  You will be introduced to Ozzy, Spirit, Cuckoo, Valentine, & Sweetie Pie - the handicapped ravens that live in the aviary.  It is a thrill to be up close and meet them.  Your hostess is very knowledgeable about the surrounding desert and species.  This is an experience that is wonderful for adults & kids!!  However, A Special Note About Young Children:  When the tortoises are out of hibernation in the summer, this is a more engaging activity for young children  When they are hibernating, the bulk of this Experience is sitting and watching the wildlife activity from an observation point, which can be very boring to young ones.  Please keep in mind if you bring your little ones that there is no place to play or run around or be loud.
Other things to note
The start time for this Experience changes.  On warm summer days, early morning visits are the best to see animal activity.  Ravens, however, talk to you all day long.  Also, young children might get bored with just watching wildlife activity.  There is no place for them to play or run around.","High Desert, United States",Nature and outdoors

Join a passionate backyard beekeeper on this unique experience and collect honey from a hive straight into a jar to take home with you.

After this, we will go to the hives and we'll open one of my Flow Hives and the process of doing a standard inspection.

People of that era used it often to carry supplies from the port to the capital. 
While we walk, you'll see mysterious statues and ruins in the rich nature of quiet air and clear water. 
After the thrill of walking along the rock walls and water streams, we'll reach the top of the hill overlooking the capital area, and the ocean beyond it. 
I'll even take you to a huge ruin of Samurai in the forest that almost nobody knows. 
 
As a nature guide, I can assert there is no other trail like this that you can enjoy various things like an adventure!

Just minutes from the busy, bustling downtown core of the city you’ll find the Toronto Islands–a five-kilometre oasis of interconnected islands that locals have been escaping to for fun, relaxation and tranquility for over 200 years.

The Islands are a popular destination during the spring and summer months, but are largely forgotten by locals and visitors during the fall and winter - a great time to experience the serenity of the Islands in a way that very few locals do!

You'll explore the beauty of the islands, the history and attractions, a quaint cottage enclave which is one of  the largest car-free communities in North America, and stunning views of the Toronto skyline.

Worried about riding in Toronto in the Winter?  Don’t believe the rumours. During winter Toronto is anything but the North Pole. In fact, the average day-time temperature is warmer than many think, and paths and roadways are usually snow-free and dry.  We provide cycling blankets (ponchos) and gloves to keep you warm.  All of this means wintertime is a wonderful time to take our Islands Bike Tour!

If you're new to wine, I can explain how to taste wines so you'll look like an expert in your next cellar door visit.

You can choose your tasting time, and there is no rush to finish by a certain time. In fact, you may want to kick back with another glass after your tasting!

We begin in one of Rome's liveliest squares, now full of bars and restaurants. However, it was once a place of execution, and reminders of this still stand - hear the tale of Giordano Bruno, one of Italy's greatest minds who got on the wrong side of the Church.
Then we take a stroll through the backstreets, arriving at one of the oldest bridges, which is haunted by one of Rome's most infamous characters.
Strolling down a medieval street, we come to a unique church, decorated with skulls, and home to a mysterious order of monks with a rather macabre task. From here, we reach the site of one of the world's most notorious historical prisons, then pass the tomb of the notorious Borgia Pope, before arriving at the home of an infamous poisoner.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/264292,"A via ferrata consists of an equipped route that climbs walls and crosses cable bridges. There will be different types of iron rungs, chains and cables attached to the wall for you to climb, there are also sections where you will be climbing on the rock.
This is a loop activity with a couple exits in the middle and before the most challenging section for those who already have enough.
The climbing is not very sustained, there are some demanding sections combined with easier ones. There is also the possibility to clip yourself into the rungs and rest or just keep climbing adding more challenge to the experience.

Clear water below your feet and vertical walls around you, these will be the view while climbing iron ladders, cross cable bridges and narrow walkways.
This Via Ferrata never gets too extreme and the perfect equipment makes it an ideal one for a first experience. 

I will handle and set all the gear in the parking and then we will walk for 10 minutes to the beginning of the via ferrata. Once there I will do a short briefing on how to climb, clip and all the safety tips.

My opinion was completely overturned when I was introduced to GREAT SAKE in Japan. It was very fragrant & fruity. Easy to drink & flowery in the aftertaste.

we leave Paris along the Canal de l'Ourcq's bike path, 
through the Parc de la Villette (one of Paris' largest green parks),
into Pantin towards Bobigny,
along some side streets on the lookout for works of Street Art,
up to the highest point of Ile-de-France to take in some magnificent views of Paris,
then on to the well-hidden villages of the Pré-Saint-Gervais and their bucolic atmosphere, before returning to Paris' cosmopolitan 19th.

Most of this trip will be on dedicated bike paths or small side streets, shielded from the bustle of the main axes.
So even if you're not accustomed to city-biking, this will be a stress-free trip. 
The itinerary is about two hours, we can make a few stops at some special points of interest (friendly cafés, a craft beer brewery,  parcs,canal...) Fresh local beer or coffee is on me!
I can adapt the itinerary to your preferences, in any case we shouldn't take more than two hours.

Looking forward to meeting you in the real Paris, far from the old clichés !

During this half-day tour, we’ll stop at the following decadent temple sites and learn the fascinating stories behind them…

Wat Saket: One of the most important religious pilgrimage sights in Thailand is Wat Saket, translating as the Golden Mountain. This hillside temple features a gleaming gold chedi that is thought to contain a relic from the Buddha himself. 

Wat Pho: Otherwise known as the Temple of the Reclining Buddha, this is one of the largest and most impressive temple sights in Bangkok. We’ll marvel at the 46-metre Buddha statue made entirely of gold leaf before exploring the attractive grounds. An endless sea of mosaic stupas make Wat Pho quite unlike other temples in the capital – little wonder it’s a UNESCO-protected site.

Wat Arun: Named the number 1 landmark in Thailand on TripAdvisor, there’s no excuse for missing Wat Arun. This religious complex, also called the Temple of Dawn, is known for its dreamy white spires that can be seen for miles around.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/1077883,"This experience is specialized for tameshigiri(test cutting). 
In this lesson you will try the most basic and fundamental cut the migi kesagiri (right side downward diagonal cut). 

When you first arrive to the dojo you will change into a traditional training uniform called a keikogi.  Guests will learn the basic history of Japanese swords and how they are manufactured. 
After that, you will practice how to swing a katana (sword) using a blunt practice sword. 
With any cut, the most critical aspect is the hasuji (angle of the blade).
If you can cut skillfully, there will be no feeling of resistance from the material being cut. However, if the angle of the blade is slightly off, you will not be able to successfully cut through the material or you may cut through the material but will experience a shock to your hands.

Now it is time to try test cutting. 
First, we will test your blade angle on a hanmaki (half of a tatami roll).
Next, you will try cutting the thicker ichimaimaki (one tatami roll). 
Finally, you will challenge yourself with a futomaki (two tatami roll)or yokonarabi(two tatami side by side). 
You can choose futomaki or yokonarabi at the dojo.
Cutting futomaki or yokonarabi can be extremely difficult for people with no experience but with good instruction it is possible. 
If the angle of your blade is correct, you will be able to cut even a futomaki or yokonarabi.

Up to 8 guests will join an expert guide who will introduce you all to the Musée de l’Armée, housed inside the gold-domed building known as the Hotel des Invalides. Both history experts and amateurs will be entranced by the vast collection of artifacts and show of opulence at this museum.

Begin by exploring the courtyard of the Invalides where your guide will reveal its 17th century roots as a veteran’s hospital under King Louis XIV, the Sun King. Walk through the cathedral dedicated to Louis’ troops who retired here in relative comfort. Louis XIV, however, was not the only leader to contribute to France’s military history. While most discuss his height, your guide will discuss the achievements of Napoleon Bonaparte as France’s most brilliant military general. While a bit too ambitious, this French emperor eventually stretched himself too thin, and once defeated, Napoleon died in exile. Today, thanks to the kings of the 19th century, his remains are housed underneath the magnificent gold dome at Invalides. Visit his tomb, as well as the tombs of those closest to him, while dropping your jaw at the ornate homage to this leader.

The guests will meet Buttercup and Cotton Candy, our angora goats, feed them treats and then take turns holding the leashes as we walk along the  nature preserve trails. This is a scenic hike through  the California Sage Brush,  with wild flowers (seasonal). While we're walking you can learn about the history of the angora goat and goat keeping in general, ask questions or simply enjoy their sweet personalities as we walk (or run) along the trail. 
Contrary to goat yoga this activity is suitable for all ages and does not require special athletic skills. We will end the walk with a mohair spinning and knitting demonstration and enjoy a cold sparkling water. 
 
Please note: Goat walking is slightly different from dog walking. Goats like to browse, meaning they regularly stop to nibble on vegetation. This makes the walk fun for them and mimics their natural behavior.  Also, just like us humans,  there are days when they feel energized and move at a fast pace (usually during cooler weather) and other days when they feel more lazy and  want to stop for snacks more often. I do not want or expect my animals to perform like  circus animals, instead I adapt to their energy level.  For that reason the hiking times and distances do vary.

- The Bridal Veil waterfall with a 60m (200') drop is the first stop of the day.   We can swim in the lagoon next to the waterfall but the real deal is to get under it.  I guarantee it will be the single most epic picture of your trip. 
- The next stop is the natural thermal waters of the Blue Lagoon in Montanejos.  The spring water comes out of the ground at a temperature of 25C the entire year.  So many things to do over there:  explore the caves, swim, dive, and even get a feet pedicure from the little fish in the lagoon.  It is another perfect spot to take amazing pictures with your friends to share on your favourite social network.
- For lunch I normally propose to eat at a nice tapas place in the village two minutes away from the springs.  For people with a specific diet they have vegetarian/vegan options.  You can also bring your own food.  
-The afternoon is spent at three different sites that will literally blow you mind.  The scenic canyons with the river at the bottom, the most gigantic water jet the comes out of a mountain and the dam.  These are my fav of the day for the craziest pictures ever.

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/900116,"Energy healing has recently come to the forefront again as more and more people awaken to the immense and powerful potential of their mind, body, and spirit to heal and create their realities.
Do you feel the urge need to live your higher Divine purpose, to be empowered to heal yourself and those around you, to help bring the world back into peace, balance, and harmony?

You will learn a self healing tool that you can use anywhere, anytime. Reiki is a Japanese healing technique that works like in acupuncture working on our energy channel/chakras. It is administered by ""laying on hands"" and is based on the idea that an unseen ""life force energy"" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's ""life force energy"" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, we are more capable of being happy and healthy. Reiki also helps to tap into our deep subconscious mind to help heal our unknown fears, anxiety and trauma that you are not aware of. By bringing that awareness to your conscious you are able to get rid of it. 
In this session you will learn 
Gassho meditation

https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/509009,"Ostia Antica is a stunningly preserved ancient Roman city—one of the best in Italy. During our time together, I will bring the ancient city to life as we pick our way through 2000-year-old apartment complexes, visit a bygone restaurant, and learn about bizarre religious cults.
Why Ostia Antica instead of Pompeii? There are three reasons, 1) Ostia it's much closer and easier to visit (25-minute train ride); 2) Ostia is a better example of a real, working class town than Pompeii; 3) visiting Ostia has a lower carbon footprint than visiting Pompeii, and given the crowds at the latter and general ""undiscovered"" feeling of the former, it's a more enjoyable, enriching experience.
We begin our Ostia Antica Tour in Rome, at Piramide Metro B station, with a short 25 minutes train ride toward the Mediterranean sea. Along the way, I will discuss the regional geography of the area, Ostia's role as Rome's port, and the historic background leading up to the town's rise in the Imperial era. On site, we will spend 2,5 hours combing through the ruins, which include some of the best examples of baths, a fantastic amphitheater, and several Mithraic temples, not to mention a forum with temples.
